<p><b>Posters. Prints, Placards, Pamphlets, and Persuasion</b></br>
There are numerous ways to illustrate an idea for the purpose of public dissemination, but the execution of this concept has varied throughout time and history. This visualization is a radial network that shows various topics, such as Military, Civil Rights, Entertainment, Politics, Industrialization, etc. Each document is a printed work that typically falls within more than one topic category, making evident the various ways in which these topics were manipulated to project an idea, opinion, advertisement, or movement. Once a ‘string’ is clicked or hovered over, it will show the details of the document while giving it context. There are currently 198 documents in my search, but this needs refining and perhaps expanding to reach the highest potential number of documents.</p>

<p><b>A World of Meteorites</b></br>
This visualization would be comprised of the meteorite collection from the mineral sciences department at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. There are 7,568 meteorites documented.
I am interested in visualizing the location and quantity of meteorites from this collection, utilizing their unique color and texture to help the viewer move across the map. The bubbles would scale up with relation to the quantity of meteorites in each region on the main map page. Once clicked, an interface will open with another bubble map or visualization that shows the various types, textures, and weights of the meteorites that were found in that location.</p>

<p><b>Aircrafts at the Air and Space Museum</b></br>
This visualization makes evident the specifications of aircrafts at the Smithsonian through a type of scatterplot. The weight, speed, and wingspan can be used to determine each aircraft’s location on the plot and upon further investigation the viewer may click an aircraft symbol to view more details. These additional details may include photos, speed, wingspan, dimensions, weight, year, make, engine, etc. This visualization may help us understand the correlation between these variables, if any. There are 113 aircrafts that fall within this category.



<h2> Designs for Final Projects </h2>
<h3>Redesign of AA Website</h3>
<p>I am looking to utilized a map to show the meetings themselves and where they are located. On the column to the right, there are various important filters to filter what you need from a meeting. On the bottom, a row will be there to show you the meeting you've selected once you click it on the map. All of the remaining details along with the address and directions will be there to view.</p>

<h3>Bread Diary</h3> 
<p>In this database, bread 'type' (wheat or white) is the primary key and 'time spent' is the secondary key. By filtering the 2, you will pull up an entry that shows the data within that entry (name, ingredients, result recordings) as well as the drawing of the bread. I hope to integrate some aesthetic elements that are hand drawn within the viz itself to make it all feel like my real bread journal does.</p>

<h3>Sensor Data: Sleep, Interrupted</h3>
<p>Using the data that I will take from the sensor, I will record and map each 24 hour period of the temperature in my bedroom and show the results in the context of my sleep patterns. The furnace in my room gets so hot and dry, I inevitably wake up and open the window, causing the temperature to drop. I hope to show small multiples to reveal a pattern, and maybe do an average scale to show it all at a glance. </p>
