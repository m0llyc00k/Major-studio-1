<p><b>A World of Meteorites</b>
This visualization would comprise the meteorite collections from the mineral sciences department at the Smithsonian Museum of Natural History. There are 7,568 meteorites documented.
I am interested in visualizing the location and quantity of meteorites from this collection, while utilizing the unique color and texture to help the viewer move across the map. The bubbles would scale up by quantity on the main map page. Once clicked, an interface will open with another bubble map or visualization that shows the various types, textures, and weights of the meteorites that were found in that location.</p>

<p><b>Posters. Prints, Placards, Pamphlets, and Persuasion</b>
There are numerous ways to illustrate an idea for the purpose of public dissemination, but the execution of this concept has varied throughout time and history. This visualization is a radial network that shows various topics, such as Military, Civil Rights, Entertainment, Politics, Industrialization, etc. Each document is a printed work that typically falls within more than one topic category, making evident the various ways in which these topics were utilized to project an idea, opinion, advertisement, or movement. Once a ‘string’ is clicked or hovered over, it will show the details of the document while giving it context. There are currently 198 documents in my search, but this needs refining and perhaps expanding to reach the highest potential number of documents.</p>

<p><b>Aircrafts at the Air and Space Museum</b>
This visualization makes evident the specifications of aircrafts at the Smithsonian through a type of scatterplot. The weight, speed, and wingspan can be used to determine each aircraft’s location on the plot and upon further investigation the viewer may click an aircraft symbol to view more details. These additional details may include photos, speed, wingspan, dimensions, weight, year, make, engine, etc. This visualization may help us understand the correlation between these variables, if any. There are 113 aircrafts that fall within this category.
